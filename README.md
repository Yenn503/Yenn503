About Me ✨
Hey there! I'm a passionate Cybersecurity Analyst and a dedicated university student, fully immersed in the dynamic world of offensive security. My drive stems from a profound curiosity: understanding how systems can be compromised allows me to build more robust defenses.

My primary areas of expertise and passion include:

Red Team Operations: Crafting and executing sophisticated adversarial simulations to rigorously test and fortify an organization's security posture. I believe the best defense comes from understanding the most advanced attacks.

Malware Analysis: Dissecting the most intricate malicious software. I love uncovering its behavior, identifying its capabilities, and extracting critical indicators of compromise (IOCs) that empower proactive defense.

Reverse Engineering: Peeling back the layers of compiled code, assembly by assembly, to unveil hidden functionalities, identify elusive vulnerabilities, and comprehend proprietary algorithms. It's like solving a high-stakes puzzle!

I thrive on hands-on research, constantly exploring advanced malware techniques and cutting-edge exploitation methods. My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to a safer digital ecosystem through ethical hacking and timely, actionable threat intelligence. I'm currently on an intensive journey to earn my OSCP certification, aiming to solidify and expand my offensive security arsenal.
